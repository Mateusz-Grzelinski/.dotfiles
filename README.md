# My dotfiles
dotfiles for bash, zshell (with zim), vim, tmux...

My personal collection of configuration files for Linux (Manjaro xfce)

I focus my workflow on vim, tmux and ssh.

This is alpha stage of dotfiles. It works but you might experience some troubles.

## Vim/Neovim
I mostly use Neovim now. It's configuration is forked here: [neovim-config](https://github.com/Mateusz-Grzelinski/vim-config)
This is my vim config:

Clone this repo to your home directory. You can yse installation script but it is pretty messy, it needs rewritting. But it works.
You should read the installation script berofe launching.
Installation script prompts to buckup your dotfiles.
Dotfiles use the folowing programs: zsh, fasd, vim, tmux.
zim will be installed to ~/.zim folder.
