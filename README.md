# .dotfiles
dotfiles for bash, zshell, vim, tmux...

My personal collection of configuration files for Linux (Manjaro xfce)
Work in (never ending) progress. 

My focus is on vim with Python plus some scripting.

Workflow is not smooth yet. 

NOT TESTED!!
PROBABLY NOT WORKING!!

Edit:

Recently a lot has changed.
Major clean and installlation script comming soon.
