# My dotfiles
dotfiles for bash, zshell (with zim), vim, tmux...

My personal collection of configuration files for Linux (Manjaro xfce)

I focus my workflow on vim, tmux and ssh.

This is alpha stage of dotfiles. It works but you might experience some troubles.

## Vim/Neovim
I mostly use Neovim now. It's configuration is forked here: [neovim-config](https://github.com/Mateusz-Grzelinski/vim-config)

This is my vim config:
